(1) we have a condition met then we have true value else we have false value. 


(2) Delete map variable previously created and replace it with 

variable "vm_size_dev" {default = "Standard_DS1_v2"}
variable "vm_size_uat" {default = "Standard_DS2_v2"}

(3) Now we can use conditions based on environment value:


vm_size               = "${"${var.environment}" == "dev" ?  var.vm_size_dev : var.vm_size_uat}"


(4) when we run plan we will see, following vm_size taken as environment is dev:

+ vm_size                          = "Standard_DS1_v2"
