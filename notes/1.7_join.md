(1) join is used to modify outout and add delimeter like "," etc. to it. 


(2) Added folowing output:
output "name" {
value = "${join("," , azurerm_virtual_machine.main.*.id)}"
}

name = "/subscriptions/fb72fb64-3638-4494-bee3-de69fbe51073/resourceGroups/tfnitin-resources/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/vm-1,/subscriptions/fb72fb64-3638-4494-bee3-de69fbe51073/resourceGroups/tfnitin-resources/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/vm-2,/subscriptions/fb72fb64-3638-4494-bee3-de69fbe51073/resourceGroups/tfnitin-resources/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/vm-3"
