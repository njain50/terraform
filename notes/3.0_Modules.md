#modules


- A module is a container for multiple resources that are used together
- Every Terraform configuration has at least one module, known as its root module, which consists of the resources defined in the .tf files in the main working directory
- A module can call other modules, which lets you include the child module's resources into the configuration in a concise way

- Modules can be accessed by root module as follows:
----------------------------------------- 
module "servers" {
source = "./app-cluster"
variable = "value to be defined or overridden"

}


------------------------------------------ 
- output from child modules can be accessed in root module as follows: 
--------------------------------------- 
value = module.resource_group.rg_name
}
