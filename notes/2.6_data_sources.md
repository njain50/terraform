- Data sources allow data to be fetched or computed for use elsewhere in Terraform configuration. Use of data sources allows a Terraform configuration to make use of information defined outside of Terraform, or defined by another separate Terraform configuration.

- Data sources can be used for a number of reasons; but their goal is to do something and then give you data.

Let's take the example from their documentation:

# Find the latest available AMI that is tagged with Component = web
data "aws_ami" "web" {
filter {
name   = "state"
values = ["available"]
}

filter {
name   = "tag:Component"
values = ["web"]
}

most_recent = true
}
This uses the aws_ami data source - this is different than a resource! It will instead just give you information, and not create anything. This example in particular will call out to the describe-images AWS API call, pass in a few --filter options as specified, and return an object that you can get information from - take a look at these attributes!

name
owner_id
description
image_id
... The list goes on. This is really useful if I were, let's say - always wanting to pull the latest AMI matching some tags, and keep a launch configuration up to date with it. I could use this data provider rather than always have to update a variable or hard-code the ID.

Data source can be used for other reasons as well; one of my favorites is the template provider.
