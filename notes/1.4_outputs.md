(1) 
output essentially is something that you see on screen once you've finished deployment and it's
a great way of getting visual information.

(2) For following resouce declared:

resource "azurerm_virtual_machine" "main" {
name                  = "${var.prefix}-vm"

------
------
}


we can declare output at end as follows:

output "virual_machine_name" {
value = "${azurerm_virtual_machine.main.name}"
}


This will give output value of resource created when we run 'terraform apply' at end as follows: 

Outputs:

virual_machine_location = "eastus2"
virual_machine_name = "tfnitin-vm"
virual_machine_network_interface = "tfnitin-network"
