Loops with for_each expressions
The for_each expression allows you to loop over lists, sets, and maps to create either (a) multiple copies of an entire resource or (b) multiple copies of an inline block within a resource

Let’s first walk through how to use for_each to create multiple copies of a resource. The syntax looks like this:
resource "<PROVIDER>_<TYPE>" "<NAME>" {
  for_each = <COLLECTION>
  [CONFIG ...]
}
where PROVIDER is the name of a provider (e.g., aws), TYPE is the type of resource to create in that provider (e.g., instance), NAME is an identifier you can use throughout the Terraform code to refer to this resource (e.g., my_instance), COLLECTION is a set or map to loop over

Note:  (lists are not supported when using for_each on a resource) and CONFIG consists of one or more arguments that are specific to that resource.

Within CONFIG, you can use each.key and each.value to access the key and value of the current item in COLLECTION.

For example, here’s how you can create the same three IAM users using for_each:
resource "aws_iam_user" "example" {
  for_each = toset(var.user_names)
  name     = each.value
}
Note the use of toset to convert the var.user_names list into a set, as for_each only supports sets and maps when used on a resource. When for_each loops over this set, it will make each user name available in each.value. The user name will also be available in each.key, though you typically only use each.key with maps of key/value pairs.
Once you’ve used for_each on a resource, it becomes a map of resources, rather than just one resource (or a list of resources as with count). To see what that means, remove the original all_arns and neo_arn output variables, and add a new all_users output variable:

output "all_users" {
  value = aws_iam_user.example
}
