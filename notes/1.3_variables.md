(1) 
Variables are defined in Terraform as follows: 

variable "prefix" {
default = "tfnitin"
}


and we can then reference varialbe later as follows: 

name     = "${var.prefix}-resources"


This is equivalent to tfnitin-resources

(2) we can also create variables.tf file to keep all variables separate and reference them in main.tf

- should be within same folder. 


variable "prefix" { default = "tfnitin" }
variable "name" { default = "resources" }
variable "location" { default = "East US 2" }


(3) we can refernce variable directly too without ${}

location = var.location

Either ways are recommended.
