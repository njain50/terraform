- Terraform can manage existing and popular service providers as well as custom in-house solutions.
- Terraform look for configuration files starting with .tf and it can run single application or entire datacenter.
- Terraform generates execution plan for what it will do to reach the designed state of infrastructure.
- Then it executes it to build the desired infrastrure. 
- As Configuration changes, terraform is able to determine what changed to build the desired infrastructure.
- The infrastructure Terraform can manage includes low-level components such as compute instances, storage, and networking, as well as high-level components such as DNS entries, SaaS features, etc.
- An important advantage of Terraform is that is supports over 100 resource providers including the major public cloud providers, such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform.
